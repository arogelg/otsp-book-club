      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>The On The Same Page Book Club began as a small gathering of friends who loved getting lost in stories. Over time, our circle has grown into a welcoming community of readers from all walks of life. Whether you're into fantasy epics, thoughtful nonfiction, or anything in between, you'll find someone here who shares your passions.</p>
